# CSS Padding

Padding is used to create space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.

## CSS Padding

The CSS `padding` properties are used to generate space around and element's content, inside of any defined borders.
With CSS you have full control over the padding. There are properties for setting the padding for each side of an element (top, right, bottom and left)

## Padding - Individual Sides

CSS has properties for specifying the padding for each side of an element.

* padding-top
* padding-right
* padding-bottom
* padding-left

All the padding properties can have the following values:

* length - specifies a padding in px, pt, cm, etc.
* % - specifies a padding in % of the width of the containing element.
* inherit - specifies that the padding should be inherited from the parent element.

Note: Negative values are not allowed.

## Padding and Element Width
The CSS `width` property specifies the width of the element's content area. The content area is the portion inside the padding, border, and margin of an element.
So, if an element has a specified width, the padding added to that element will be added to the total width of the element. This is often an undesirable result.
