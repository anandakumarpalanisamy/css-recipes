## Designing For The Best Experience For All Users
Web pages can be viewed using many different devices: desktops, tablets, and phones. Your web page should look good,
and be easy to use, regardless of the device.
Web pages should not leave out information to fit smaller devices, but rather adopt its content to fit any device.

It is called Responsive Web Design when you use CSS and HTML to resize, hide, shrink, enlarge or move the content to make it look good on any screen.
